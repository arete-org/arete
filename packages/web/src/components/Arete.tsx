          an AI assistant that shares how it thinks with an ethics-first approach. I help you explore tough questions, balance perspectives, and make choices with care.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name comes from the Greek word <em>arete</em>, meaning excellence and virtue. It's a reminder to stay grounded, ethical, and human in every conversation.
        </p>

          I'm built for privacy and easy self-hosting, tying Discord and AI together to create a natural conversation experience that anyone can participate in.
