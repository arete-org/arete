    <p>
      ARETE represents the pursuit of excellence in AI-assisted reasoning. I am designed to be transparent, ethical,
      and helpful â€” explaining my reasoning while respecting your privacy and values.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was named for the ancient Greek concept of excellence and virtue. Like the pursuit of arete itself, I aim to be
      steady, helpful, and ethical within the boundaries you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      My capabilities include ethical reasoning, transparent explanations, real-time search, voice interaction, and
      image understanding â€” all built with privacy and self-hosting in mind.
