# Daneel

Daneel is a AI assistant that can help you with a variety of tasks. Daneel is written in TypeScript and constructed on a client-server architecture, feeding both a web frontend and Discord bot.


## Discord Bot

Daneel is a continuation of RolyBot, a Discord bot which used an openAI fine-tuned model to generate responses to user queries in my own writing style. Daneel extends this functionality by adding a web frontend and more advanced AI logic.

It utilizes the discord.js library to interact with the Discord API.


## Web Client
