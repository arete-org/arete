## Architecture Overview

### Main Bot File (`bot.js`)
- **Entry Point**: The main bot file initializes the Discord client and sets up event listeners.
- **Key Components**:
  - Discord.js Client with Gateway Intents
  - Memory Management System
  - Game Manager (Chess)
  - Command Handler
  - Message Classifier

### Initialization Flow
1. Loads environment variables
2. Creates Discord client with necessary intents
3. Sets up global error handlers
4. Implements login with retry mechanism
5. Initializes memory manager and game manager
6. Sets up event listeners for messages and interactions

### Key Dependencies
- `discord.js`: Core Discord API interaction
- `dotenv`: Environment variable management
- `natural`: Natural language processing utilities
- `chess.js`: Chess game logic and move validation
- `node-uci`: Interface to Stockfish chess engine
- Custom utilities for memory, chess, and message processing

## Core Components

### 1. Memory Management System

#### Memory Manager (`utils/memoryManager.js`)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Implements a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists
- **Initialization**:
  - Loads configuration from environment variables
  - Sets up memory retriever with configurable parameters
  - Handles background synchronization
- **Key Features**:
  - Memory synchronization across channels
  - Background memory loading
  - Graceful error handling and recovery
  - Thread-safe operations
- **Limitations**:
  - No persistent storage between restarts
  - Limited memory capacity (default 500 items)
  - Potential memory leaks if not properly cleaned up

#### Memory Retriever (`utils/memoryRetrieval.js`)
- **Multi-dimensional Relevance Scoring**:
  - Cosine similarity for semantic meaning
  - Jaccard similarity for structural token matching
  - Levenshtein distance for fine-grained text comparison
- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Tiered filtering with configurable thresholds
  - Context-aware matching (channel, guild, temporal)
  - Rate limiting and memory size management
- **Memory Initialization**:
  - Loads historical messages from Discord channels
  - Processes messages into memory format
  - Handles pagination and rate limits
- **Strengths**:
  - Sophisticated relevance algorithms
  - Configurable thresholds and weights
  - Detailed logging and error handling
- **Weaknesses**:
  - High memory usage with large message history
  - No persistent storage
  - Complex configuration

## Chess System

### Game Manager (`utils/chess/gameManager.js`)
- **Game Lifecycle**:
  - Creates and manages game instances
  - Handles player challenges and matchmaking
  - Manages game state and persistence
- **Thread Management**:
  - Creates dedicated threads for each game
  - Manages thread lifecycle and cleanup
  - Handles thread permissions and notifications
- **Move Processing**:
  - Validates and executes player moves
  - Handles move notation conversion
  - Manages game state transitions
- **AI Integration**:
  - Coordinates with AI move service
  - Handles turn management between players and AI
  - Manages difficulty levels

### AI Move Service (`utils/chess/aiMoveService.js`)
- **Stockfish Integration**:
  - Interfaces with Stockfish chess engine
  - Handles engine initialization and cleanup
  - Manages engine processes
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - Multiple predefined difficulty settings
  - Configurable search depth and time limits
  - Randomized move selection for lower difficulties
- **Move Generation**:
  - Generates best moves using Stockfish
  - Handles move promotion and special cases
  - Validates moves before execution

### Challenge Manager (`utils/chess/challengeManager.js`)
- **Challenge Lifecycle**:
  - Manages creation and expiration of chess challenges
  - Tracks challenge timestamps and timeouts
  - Handles cleanup of expired challenges
- **Challenge Validation**:
  - Prevents duplicate or conflicting challenges
  - Validates challenge participants
  - Ensures users can only have one active challenge at a time
- **Data Management**:
  - Uses in-memory storage for active challenges
  - Implements automatic cleanup of expired challenges
  - Provides thread-safe challenge operations

### Thread Manager (`utils/chess/threadManager.js`)
- **Thread Creation**:
  - Creates dedicated threads for each chess game
  - Handles thread naming with player usernames
  - Manages thread auto-archiving
- **User Management**:
  - Tracks thread ownership by user ID
  - Manages thread permissions for players
  - Handles thread cleanup on game end
- **Voice Channel Integration**:
  - Optional voice channel setup for games
  - Manages voice channel claims and releases
  - Handles voice state updates
- **Error Handling**:
  - Validates thread operations
  - Gracefully handles missing permissions
  - Recovers from Discord API errors

### Thread Utilities (`utils/chess/threadUtils.js`)
- **Thread Management**:
  - Singleton pattern for thread utility access
  - Thread creation and retrieval
  - Thread membership management
- **Game-Thread Association**:
  - Maps game states to Discord threads
  - Handles thread ID persistence
  - Manages thread lifecycle
- **Thread Discovery**:
  - Searches for existing game threads
  - Handles thread naming conventions
  - Recovers from thread access issues
- **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful degradation on permission issues
  - Comprehensive error logging
  - Thread cleanup on game end

### Move Parser (`utils/chess/moveParser.js`)
- **Move Notation**:
  - Parses algebraic notation (e.g., "e4", "Nf3")
  - Handles natural language moves (e.g., "knight to f3")
  - Validates move syntax
- **Move Validation**:
  - Checks move legality
  - Handles castling, en passant, and promotion
  - Validates move against game state
- **Move Conversion**:
  - Converts move notation to internal format
  - Handles move serialization and deserialization
  - Manages move history

### Message Classifier (`utils/messageClassifier.js`)
- **Intent Recognition**:
  - Classifies messages as chess commands or general chat
  - Handles natural language chess move input
  - Identifies game management commands
- **Chess Command Processing**:
  - Parses algebraic notation (e.g., "e4", "Nf3")
