# Feature Proposal: Ethical Model Autonomy via AI Toolkit + Cloudflare Workers AI

**Status:** Draft  
**License Context:** MIT + HL3 (Human Rights, No State Violence/Torture/Genocide, No Forced Labor)  
**Author:** ARETE Core Team  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27

## Overview

This proposal introduces an **open, ethical, and portable AI development workflow** built on two complementary technologies:

1. **AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** — a full-cycle AI development suite for discovering, fine-tuning, converting, and evaluating models locally or in the cloud.  
2. **Cloudflare Workers AI** — an edge-native inference platform for running open-licensed models securely and privately, close to end users.

Together they form an infrastructure for **ethical model autonomy**, enabling ARETE to move away from closed APIs while preserving auditability, provenance, and performance.

---

## Motivation

ARETE’s ethical framework emphasizes **transparency, auditability, and independence from opaque model providers**. Current reliance on proprietary APIs (e.g., OpenAI) creates friction with this philosophy.  
The combination of AI Toolkit and Cloudflare Workers AI offers:

- **Model sovereignty** – run and adapt open models under clear licenses.  
- **Data privacy** – inference occurs within controlled infrastructure.  
- **Audit trails** – provenance metadata can capture the full chain: model source → fine-tuning → deployment → response.  
- **Operational simplicity** – both tools integrate seamlessly with existing developer environments (VS Code, GitHub, Fly.io, etc.).

## Design Overview

### 1. AI Toolkit for VS Code (Development Layer)

AI Toolkit serves as the **laboratory** for model discovery, customization, and evaluation.

**Capabilities:**
- Browse models from **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, GitHub, ONNX, and Ollama**.
- Run **local inference** for privacy or cost control.
- Perform **fine-tuning** using local GPUs or Azure Container Apps.
- **Convert and quantize** models (e.g., Hugging Face → ONNX) for efficient deployment.
- Integrate with **MCP servers** to connect ARETE’s tools, datasets, and ethics-core.
- Evaluate model performance with built-in metrics (relevance, coherence, F1, etc.).

### 2. Cloudflare Workers AI (Deployment Layer)

Workers AI acts as the **runtime** for serving models at the edge.

**Capabilities:**
- Execute inference near users for low latency and strong privacy boundaries.
- Access open models such as **Llama 2**, **Mistral**, and **Whisper**.  
- Integrate directly with existing **Cloudflare Workers** (e.g., those handling Turnstile validation and provenance logging).
- Scale automatically under Cloudflare’s free or paid tiers.

### 3. Integration Flow

```text
User → Turnstile (CAPTCHA)
     → Cloudflare Worker (request handler + provenance)
        → Workers AI (model inference)
        ↔ MCP tools via AI Toolkit (context injection, ethics-core access)
        → Response with provenance footer
```

This architecture allows ARETE to:
- Maintain **transparent provenance logs** across the reasoning pipeline.
- Swap model providers without code changes.
- Keep user data within an auditable ethical boundary.

## Implementation Plan

| Phase | Description | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **1. Prototype** | Connect AI Toolkit to a local Ollama or ONNX model; log provenance metadata. | Local prototype showing reasoning trace. |
| **2. Edge Deployment** | Deploy a simple inference Worker using Cloudflare’s AI runtime. | Public endpoint running open model inference. |
| **3. Integration with MCP** | Register ethics-core and provenance loggers as MCP tools in AI Toolkit. | Cross-tool context sharing and trace visibility. |
| **4. Unified Provenance Layer** | Standardize metadata format between AI Toolkit traces and ARETE ethics-core schema. | End-to-end verifiable reasoning chain. |

---

## Ethical and Technical Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Transparency** | Full traceability from model source to output. |
| **Pluralism** | Toolkit supports multiple providers and frameworks. |
| **Auditability** | Provenance metadata stored in ethics-core. |
| **Human Oversight** | Local model testing encourages direct human evaluation. |
| **Freedom with Responsibility** | Open licensing ensures responsible reuse and adaptation. |

---

## Future Directions

- **Hybrid deployment:** Serve small reasoning tasks via Workers AI, complex reasoning through local or Fly.io-hosted models.  
- **ARETE Lens compatibility:** Expose each reasoning lens (e.g., Core, Jedi, Stonerism) as a fine-tuned model variant within the Toolkit.  
- **Open provenance standard:** Publish a shared schema for tracing AI reasoning across Toolkits, Workers, and ethics-core instances.
