# ARETE Development Rules for Codex
# 
# This file directs Codex to use the main project rules.
# For complete development guidelines, see: cursor.rules
#
# Key points for AI assistants:
# - Always include ARETE module annotations (@arete-module, @arete-risk, @arete-ethics, @arete-scope)
# - Use structured logging with scoped loggers following the @arete-logger pattern
# - Follow TypeScript best practices and fail-open design patterns
# - Maintain cost tracking for all LLM interactions via ChannelContextManager
# - Preserve provenance comments and licensing headers
#
# Reference the complete rules in cursor.rules for:
# - Detailed module tagging requirements
# - Scoped logger formatting standards  
# - TypeScript and code quality standards
# - ARETE framework principles
# - Testing requirements
#
# The cursor.rules file contains the authoritative, up-to-date guidelines
# that should be followed for all code changes in this project.
